## Hospitality-House-Survey Research
Background on HH: Hospitality House is a multiple-program agency serving predominantly adult residents of San Franciscoâ€™s Tenderloin, Sixth Street Corridor, and Mid-Market neighborhoods struggling with homelessness, poverty, and the range of other socioeconomic issues facing residents here. They have six different programs funded mostly by the Department of Public Health. The DPH mandates that HH conducts an annual satisfaction survey for the clients served. Funding for HH depends on this survey. The survey results also help HH design action plans for future programming.

This research was completed in a semester long health project while I was a student at SFSU. Requirements for project: enter the paper survey data into Qualtrics, conduct data analysis in Stata present findings on response rates, satisfaction rates and program outcomes, do cross-tabs to check for any demographic disparities and/or program disparities.  

Unfortunately, I can't share the CSV file (due to confidentiality reasons). The Stata script is provided to show the data analysis I completed.
